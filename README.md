# Card Payment Cashier System
This is a cashier sytem, I am currently developing for my school. I recently changed to use the phalcon framework. See below for an installation guide. The provided version is the prototype 1, which includes customers (people who have an id and an amount of money), deposting and withdrawing money, selling, waremanagement (without inventory) and financal outcome.

# Should I consider using this system? #
No, well not at the very moment. It is under active development, even if you don't see it in the commits, since my workflow is broken. This software will be used at my school starting from the 21st August 2018. Once the launch month is survived, I will patch the software to be more configurable in terms of language and Branding, to use more of the phalcon features (this the first project I ever used phalcon and an mvc framework) and use the features more the way they are proposed for and then I am securing the software against stuff we will experience in my school. Now, why should you consider using this system?
1. It is open. (Check the restrictions of the MIT Liscense)
2. I am supporing and paching the software up to Q1 2019 for my client.
3. It is free.
4. I am open to feedback and improvments.
5. Need a customized solution and can not help yourself? I am busy up to Q1/Q2 2019 however you can contact me using e-mail or discord.

If you use this software and modify it's core parts, please think of submiting it back to this project to get the base better.

# Language #
As I have a set deadline and as I doing it for a german school, this project will be in German. I am going to translate and unify it in late august/ mid september.

# Current Tasks #
- Finding a nice way of logging
- Add logs to all important actions (basically all :D)
- Add missing form validations (very important, even though phql prevents SQL Injections...)
- Make the software more configurable (branding)
- Make all texts translatable and exclude them into lang files
- Add a lot documenary
- Make the code clearer and better readable
- Make the Software understandable in english

This is just a short notice of ToDos for me, so that I keep on track what I wanted to do next. The tasks are just a help and nether is this list prioritizing any task nor is a task carved in stone. If you want to add something, the issues are open!

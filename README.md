# Card Payment Cashier System
This is a cashier sytem, I am currently developing for my school. I recently changed to use the phalcon framework. See below for an installation guide.

# Language #
As I have a set deadline and as I doing it for a german school, this project will be often in German. I am going to translate and unify it in late august/ mid september.

# Installation #
1. Install a webserver (i.e. [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html))
2. Follow the installation guide of phalcon found [here](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon) or [here for XAMPP](https://docs.phalconphp.com/en/3.3/webserver-xampp), the downloads are [here](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/releases/tag/v3.4.0)
3. Questions? Feel free to ask.

# How to help #
1. I am not an expirenced (PHP) programmer. Therefore it is likely to find bad code and/or security issues.
2. Setup the latest version from the master and try to break stuff - then once you found something check the issues and give detailed informations and if you can a solution.

# The Rest #
This project uses [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/).
